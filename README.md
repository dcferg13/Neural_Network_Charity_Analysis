# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
A binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help Alphabet Soup find applicants who would be the most successful if they were given funds by using a binary classifier.  With the CSV file given to us, of the 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding, we cleaned the data, created and trained a neural network model and finally optimized the model to find the best results.
